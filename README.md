# 🤖 What is WumpusBud?

**WumpusBud** is an *upcoming* Discord bot made with JavaScript and discord.js. The idea of the bot is to let you manage your own Wumpus pet and collect coins to buy resources. This repository is **open source**, and you can freely selfhost the bot, as long as you credit me and the other contributors.
# 💻 Setting the bot up

 Configurating the config.json
```json
{
  "token": "Bot_Token",
  "mongoURI": "MongoDB_URI",
  "devs": ["Your_ID"],
  "prefix": "Bot_Prefix",
  "guildId": "Support_Server_ID",
  "clientId": "Bot_ClientID",
  "inviteURL": "Bot_OAuth2_URL"
}
```

## 💽 Install packages and running the bot
```sh
npm install
node index.js
```
